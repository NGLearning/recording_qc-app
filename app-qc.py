The video content is based on the following presentation slides:
--- PPT Content Start ---
{ppt_text}
--- PPT Content End ---

Below is the transcript of the video that needs to be quality checked:
--- Transcript Start ---
{video_transcript}
--- Transcript End ---

You are part of a data science team at an EdTech company. Your task is to review the above video transcript and its corresponding PPT content for quality, using the checklist below.

### Checklist:

**General Checks:**
1. Identify the topics and sub-topics taught in the session, in order and in the form of a hierarchical list
2. Interpret what the learning outcomes were from the session (use Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy to synthesize outcomes)
3. Identify any logistic / technical issues that occurred in the recording
4. Identify any comments that are potentially racist, inflammatory, sexually inappropriate, biased, or polarizing
5. Assess whether there is any mismatch in the faculty's tone, particularly signs of low energy or engagement

**For Conceptual Teaching:**
6. Scrutinize for any flow-related inaccuracies or misleading information presented by the mentor
7. Determine the pace of the recording by looking at how quickly the topics were progressing in the teaching

**For Code Walkthrough:**
Note: The following items apply **only if the video is a code walkthrough**. If this is a conceptual explanation and no code walkthrough is present, mark each item as "N/A - Not a code walkthrough video".
8. Is the walkthrough of the code sequential and line-by-line? Does the faculty skip explaining any sections?
9. Are all essential features of the code discussed? Is there a comprehensive explanation of key functions, methods, or classes?
10. Is the faculty explaining all the logic present in the code clearly?
11. Does the faculty talk about the functions being used, why they were written and how they work?
12. When using in-built functions and methods, does the faculty explain what each parameter does and why we need them?
13. Is there a clear explanation of the expected output from the code? Does the instructor validate output results and explain discrepancies, if any?
14. Are real-world examples or use cases provided to contextualize the code?

### Output Format:
- For each checklist item, respond with ‚úÖ or ‚ùå.
- If ‚ùå, add 1‚Äì2 lines explaining the issue.
- At the end, provide a short bullet list of what went wrong and how to improve in two separate heading.
- Do not use special characters like ### or ***.

Generate only the checklist and bullet point feedback. Do not include unnecessary explanation or summary.
